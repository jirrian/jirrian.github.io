The speakers are fed audio through aux cord inputs connected to mobile devices playing different videos. The audio quality is intentionally distorted with a lot of interference and feedback. The goal was to depict a synthetic skin that comes to life through media. The speakers’ audio blend together, conceptually imbuing the skin with media."

The ghost wanders around the area aimlessly but comes towards the viewer every so often. The ghost is made from media, a combination of 3D models of robot and anime figures readily downloadable from the internet. The goal of this piece was to create a digital synthetic ghost with a haunting presence."
